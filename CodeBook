# Getting and Cleaning Data Code Book

1. Data for the project comes from 
"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
File "getdata_dataset.zip" is extracted and creates folder "UCI HAR Dataset".
It consists of the following files:
- features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. 
    Its range is from 1 to 30.

2. The columns of the Training tables (train_subject, train_y, train_x) are merged and prefixed 
   with a column to distinguish test and training data. Columns of the Test tables (test_subject, test_y, test_x) 
   are also merged and prefixed with a similar column to demark data as Test (vs Training).
   
3. Test data is appended to Training data in the "combined_data" file.

4. A file ("has_mean_or_std") is created that includes only columns with measurements of the mean and standard deviation.
   The integers representing Activity are replaced with the text name (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
   SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).
   
5. The column names ar modified to be more readable.  Specifically:
- “tBody" to "TimeBody
- “fBody" to "FreqBody"
-“tGravity" to "TimeGravity
“-mean" to "Mean"
"-std" to "Std"
   Also fixed typo to change "BodyBody" to "Body"

6. Create a file (avg_subj_activity) to that contains the average for each measure and is sirted by Subject, then Activtiy, 
   then Type (Train" or "Test").

7. The final tidy file is saved to an Excel fie (avg_subj_activity.xlsx).
